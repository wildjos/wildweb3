# WildWeb3
WildWeb3 is my space for experimenting with smart contracts, testing Web3 ideas, and documenting tricky implementations. This project is a sandbox where I explore different aspects of blockchain development, keep examples of interesting Solidity contracts, and refine my engineering skills.

## What’s Inside?
🔍 Smart Contract Experiments – A collection of cool, tricky, and maybe useful Solidity examples.
💡 Web3 Testing Ground – A place to try out different deployment strategies and integrations.
🖥 Interactive UI – A Streamlit-powered frontend to test and showcase contracts.
⚙️ REST API Backend – Uses FastAPI to drive compilation, deployment, and contract interaction.
📦 Dockerized Setup – Ensuring an isolated and reproducible development environment.
🛡 Security Practices – Experiments with key management, Infura API usage, and best practices.
🚀 Future Expansion – Eventually exploring Rust for Web3 backend services or contract compilation.

WildWeb3 is not a polished framework — it's my place for testing ideas, trying things out, and recording my blockchain development journey.
