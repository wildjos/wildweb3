# WildWeb3

WildWeb3 is my space for experimenting with smart contracts, testing Web3 ideas, and documenting tricky implementations. This project is a sandbox where I explore different aspects of blockchain development, keep examples of interesting Solidity contracts, and try out some different things.

## What’s Inside?

- [ ] 🔍 Smart Contract Experiments – A collection of cool, tricky, and sometimes useful Solidity examples.
- [ ] 💡 Web3 Testing Ground – A place to test contracts.
- [ ] 🖥 Interactive UI – A Streamlit-powered frontend for user ease of use.
- [ ] ⚙️ REST API Backend – Uses FastAPI to drive compilation, deployment, and contract interaction.
- [ ] 📦 Dockerized Setup – Ensuring an isolated and reproducible development environment.
- [ ] 🛡 Security Practices – Experiments with key management, Infura API usage, and best practices.
- [ ] 🚀 Future Expansion – Eventually exploring Rust for Web3 backend services or contract compilation.

WildWeb3 is not a polished framework — it's my place for testing ideas, trying things out, and recording my blockchain development journey.
